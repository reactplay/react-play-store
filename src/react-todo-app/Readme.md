# React-Todo App

It is a Todo App made with React to keep track of the tasks you plan to complete within a specific amount of time, most probably a day. Users can create a task, edit a task, mark a task 'complete' and delete a task.

## What will you learn?

- Use of `useEffect` hook.
- Event handling for user interaction.
- State management

The file `ReactTodoApp` is the main file along with the css and other files in the component folder required to build the Todo App.
If you want to implement your learnings about states and useEffect hooks try implementing it on your own!
