The `States Play` demonstrates the following concepts in React:
1.  State & State Management in functional components.
2.  useState Hook
3.  Event Handling
4.  Object Destructing

This play has two input fields that asks the user for a Name and the duration. Once provides the necessary inputs and click on Submit, a message is displayed on the right side. 
Message is `Welcome to State Play, {name}` where name will be the name value provided by the user. This message will be displayed for `duration` seconds provided by the user.
Once the `duration` amount of seconds are over, the input fields will be reset and the message on right side will disappear. If the user leaves any field blank the submit button won't be functional.
