# Random Meme Generator

This project demonstrates the use of API in order to fetch random memes!

## What will you learn?

- How to use APIs in React.
- Importance of `useEffect` hook.
- Event handling for user interaction.
- State management

The file `RandomMemeGenerator.jsx` has all the code required to build a meme generator! So, if you want to get a grasp of it, try implementing it on your own!

I have used [Meme_Api](https://github.com/D3vd/Meme_Api) to generate memes but you can use any api of your choice!

Keep Learning!
