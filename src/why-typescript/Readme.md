# Why Typescript
The `Why Typescript` project shows how `TypeScript` can be used .

- It uses simple concept of interface.
- Leverages class and objects.
- Demonstrates the power of casting.
- Shows a process to load json onto your application.
- It shows component creation using TypeScript and consumption

Well, TypeScript is way more than what has been demonstrated here. The idea is to bring a pointer where "sky is the only limit"

Happy Coding!
