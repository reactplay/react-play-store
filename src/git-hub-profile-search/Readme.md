# GitHub Profile Search

A play where you can search anybody's public github profile. I have made it using Context Api for showing basic implementation which you can practice in order to get comfortable with using Context Api for bigger projects.

The search result provides you with one user whose username matches with his/her profile link, bio, followers, as well as the current 5 public repositories made by the user starting from the latest.
