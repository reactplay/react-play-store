# Social Card
The `Social Card` project demonstrate many key concepts of ReactJS.

- Form Handling.
- Managing Complex state data like object and how to update it with the single handler.
- Usage of React Context with the `useContext` hook.
- Usage of adding focus to the input element with the `useRef` hook.

If you are planning to look into the code in details, please start with the `SocialCard.jsx` file. You will find that we are initializing the context there and wrapping the form and details component with it.

Please check the `CardForm.jsx` file to understand how form handling works with the object
as a the state value. We have used a single handler to handle every change in the form.

The `CardDetails.jsx` file is the one that is responsible for the rendering of the details. We also use the theming option there.

Happy Learning!
