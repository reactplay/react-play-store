# Quizeo

Quizeo is a react fun project to play quiz around favourite movies and series, if you have watched.

## What you will learn
The app demonstrates 
- the use of reusable components, shows you how to divide your react app into components
- use of react-redux
- use of react-redux with hooks
- use of reselect for better memoization and cache management
- use of ES6 features

The app uses redux store to store the state and data of the app globally and is fetched with the help of selectors 'react-reselect' to implement memoization to the app. Also each component contains its own CSS for easy implementation of design.

Happy learning!
